// Each program has a calculated TIME_PAIN, if the greater the TIME_PAiN, the less "punishment" you get. Punishement being random changes of variables and random skiping of lines of code

// In this language the main code is written in simbols here is the structure {
  There is a time pointer which moves in forward while the program executes.
  | - adds a new timeline out of the current time with the dublicates value
  $+ - sums up the values in the bellow timeline and collapses them into the previous timeline 
  $- - subtracts the values in the bellow timeline and collapses them into the previous timeline
  & - set cell to one
  > - move down a timeline
  < - move up a timeline
  ; - output current timeline value
  # - input into current timeline
  {} - while current cell isn't 0
  [] - while multiple timelines
}

Input charector and output the next one
#|{-}$+;
